Something2GSN plugin
===============================
Version
----------------
1.0.0

Available for
----------------
Astah Professional 6.6 or later, Astah SysML 1.2 or later and Astah GSN 1.1 or later

Description
----------------
The plugin converts models on Class diagrams, Activity Diagrams, Block Definition diagrams and Mindmaps created in Astah Products to GSN (Goal Structuring Notation) models.


How to install
----------------
[Download Astah Something2GSN plugin jar file.]()

### [If you are using Astah Professional]
1. Launch Astah and drag the downloaded .jar file to an open instance of Astah. A pop-up will appear asking you to confirm installation, choose [Yes].
3. If the pop-up opens, restart Astah and open any project.
3. Now you will have [GSN generator] item under [Tools] menu.

### [If you are using Astah SysML]
1. Launch Astah and go to [Help] - [Plugin List].
2. Click [Install] button and select the .jar file you downloaded.
3. Restart Astah and open any project.
3. Now you will have [GSN generator] item under [Tools] menu.

### [If you are using Astah GSN]
1. Save the downloaded .jar file under Userhome/.astah/gsn/plugins
2. Restart Astah and open any project
3. Now you will have  [GSN generator] item under [Tools] menu.

How to use
----------------
### Diagrams to convert
1. Below is a sample MindMap before converting to GSN:
![MindMap Image](doc/mindmap.png)
Each topic must have a suffix starting with a colon followed by strings like "goal" or "strategy", which to specify the GSN model type to convert in to. All the supported model types are as follows:
- goal
- strategy
- solution
- context
- assumption
- justification

As I explain later, the plugin supports the following model types and diagrams other than MindMap:
- Classes and Objects in Class diagrams,
- Objects in Activity Diagrams and
- Blcks in Block Definition Diagrams.

The plugin cannot convert to GSN/D-Case models correctly if the relations among models (structure in Mind Map) are incorrect in terms of the GSN syntax.


### Generating GSN/D-Case from a MindMap

1. Select a MindMap you want to convert to GSN/D-Case in the structure tree view.
![MindMap Selection Image](doc/mindmap_selection.png)
2. From [Tools] menu, choose [GSN Generator] and then [Generating GSN for the current diagram].
![Menu Image](doc/menu.png)
3. A dialog appears to ask you to save this file, name it and save with "xmi" extension.

### Obtaining GSN/D-Case

1. Launch Astah GSN.
![astah* GSN/D-Case Image](doc/astah_gsn_dcase.png)
2. Open an existing project, or create a new one.
![astah* GSN/D-Case New Project Image](doc/gsn_new.png)
3. From [Tools] menu, choose [XMI] and then [XMI import].
![astah* GSN/D-Case Menu Image](doc/gsn_menu.png)
4. A file chooser appears. Select the.xmi file you've generated by this plugin, then imported models will appear in the tree.

5. So create a new GSN diagram or open an existing one. Drag & drop the models from the tree to GSN diagram to decipt them on the diagram.

6. Go to [Alignment] - [Auto Layout].
![astah* GSN/D-Case Auto Layout Menu](doc/auto_layout_menu.png)
7. GSN-converted models would be aligned nicely keeping its structure.

### Converting from other diagram types than Mind Maps

#### Objects in a class diagram (Astah Professional)
Objects and connected links in the following Class diagram can be converted to GSN. (Note the converted GSN models will lose color setting.) To convert to GSN, all the objects need to have the following class type : "goal", "strategy", "context", "assumption", and "justification", set to specify which GSN model type that you want them convert into.

![GSN/D-Case written by objects in class diagram](doc/objects_in_class_diagram.png)

Here's a sample GSN that was converted from the Class diagram above.

![GSN/D-Case translated from objects in class diagram](doc/translated_gsn.png)

#### Converting Classes in a class diagram (Astah Professional)
Classes and all the associations would be converted to GSN models. Specify which GSN model type to be converted by adding the stereptype.

![GSN/D-Case written by classes in class diagram](doc/classes_in_class_diagram.png)

### Converting Objects in activity diagram (Astah Professional and SysML)
Objects and connected relations would be converted to GSN models. All the objects need to have the following class type : "goal", "strategy", "context", "assumption", and "justification", set to specify which GSN model type that you want them convert into, and same goes for Blocks in Astah SysML's activity diagrams.

![GSN/D-Case written by objects in activity diagram in astah* Pro](doc/objects_in_activity_diagram.png)

For the case of Astah SysML, the diagram can be as follows.

![GSN/D-Case written by objects in activity diagram in astah* SysML](doc/activity_diagram_in_sysml.png)

### Converting Blocks in a Block definition diagram (Astah SysML)
Blocks and all the relationships in Block Definition Diagram would be converted to GSN. Add stereotype to specify what GSN model type you want them to convert into.

![GSN/D-Case written by blocks in block definition diagram in astah* SysML](doc/blocks_in_bdd.png)

### Others
If necessary, you can re-order the ID number of GSN-converted models by choosing [Reset GSN ID] from the context menu which you can open by right-clickng on the diagram editor.
